FOLDER STRUCTURE
================
- common:
	we need to create a APP_NAME-vars.sh file to set values for IMAGE_REPO_NAME, DEPLOYMENT_NAME, CONTAINER_NAME for each app

- Jenkins node:
	/home/jenkins
		restaurant
			deploy -- scripts for building the image and publishing to docker hub (we need APP_NAME-vars.sh)
			app-name -- contains the dockerfile and the dist folder(we nee to repeat this folder for each app like security, dashboard-be... )
				backup -- for storing the artifacts
				Dockerfile
				dist -- artifact contents
- ansible:
	/home/matt
		kube-cluster -- inventory and playbooks for k8s
    k8s -- k8s objects like deployments, services ... , some objects have jinja2 template sintax
    deploy -- scripts and vars
