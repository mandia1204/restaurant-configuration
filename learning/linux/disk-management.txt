shows disk usage information:
df -h

show free space:
parted
print free

resize partition:
print
resizepart (it will ask for partition number and size, get that info from print command) , should give number in GB ,example: 25.6GB

after resize we need to update the filesystem:
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda2 (get this from df -h)
df -h
